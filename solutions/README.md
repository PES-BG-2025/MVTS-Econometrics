# Solutions

This folder contains solutions to laboratory exercises.

## Structure

Solutions are organized to match the lab structure:
- `lab01_solution.R` - Solution to Lab 01 exercises
- `lab02_solution.R` - Solution to Lab 02 exercises
- etc.

## Guidelines for Students

1. **Attempt exercises first**: Try to complete lab exercises before looking at solutions
2. **Use as learning tool**: Solutions are meant to help you learn, not just provide answers
3. **Compare approaches**: Your solution may differ from the provided one - both can be valid
4. **Understand the code**: Make sure you understand each line, don't just copy

## Guidelines for Instructors

When adding solutions:
- Include comments explaining the reasoning
- Show alternative approaches when applicable
- Highlight common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Include interpretation of results, not just code

## Solution Format

Each solution file should include:
```r
# Lab XX Solution
